# Spotlight Search (for linux)

This project is my **spotlight search** made for linux using C++ and Qt-6</br>
I made this for myself, and I use Bazzite/Gnome. Compatibility with more desktops/distros is coming soon.


Right now this project is in it's early stages. I made this to be a spotlight search/powertoys run alternative for</br>
linux. I know [Vicinae](https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae) already exists, but I personally don't like it due to the lack of a bunch of features.

<h2>✰ About</h2>
Recently I decided to start using Linux on my PC for faster gaming and more customizability, so after installing Bazzite and getting all my apps set up, I realised there was something missing. To get stuff done on my Mac, I use Raycast. On Windows, I used PowerToys Run. After searching for a bit, I found Vicinae, but it didn't have searching and was quite unfinished. So now I'm just making my own spotlight search. I'm basing the ui off the new Spotlight search on MacOS 26.
